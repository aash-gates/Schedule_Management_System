# Customized Taskbar and Schedule Table

This is a customized taskbar and schedule table made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

Below the taskbar is a table that displays your schedule for the day. The table has 7 rows and 4 columns: Date, Description, Location, and Time. The Date column displays the date in a format of "DD-MM-YYYY". The Time column displays the time in a 12-hour format with AM/PM.

On the top left corner of the table, there is a mini column that displays the present date.

On the top right corner of the taskbar, there are two buttons that allow you to navigate through your schedule.
